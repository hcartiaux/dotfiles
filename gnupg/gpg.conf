#-----------------------------
# default key
#-----------------------------

# The default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is
# the first key found in the secret keyring
# If you have more than 1 secret key in your keyring, you may want to
# use the following option and set your preferred keyid.

# behavior
#-----------------------------

# Uncomment the following option to get rid of the copyright notice

# List all keys (or the specified ones) along with their fingerprints
with-fingerprint

# Display the calculated validity of user IDs during key listings

# Try to use the GnuPG-Agent. With this option, GnuPG first tries to connect to
# the agent before it asks for a passphrase.
