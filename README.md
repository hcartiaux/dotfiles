# Hyacinthe's dot files

These are my configuration files for `bash`, `git`, `vim`, etc. to set up a
system the way I like it.

In the sequel, when providing a command, `$>` denotes a prompt and is not part
of the commands.

## Pre-requisites

You should install the following elements to use the full functionality of
these config files:

* `zsh`
* `zsh-completions`
* `bash`
* `bash-completions`
* `powerline`
* `screen`
* `tmux`
* `git`
* `vim`
* `ssh`

## Installation

Run the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/hcartiaux/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    $> ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

## Environment

I use primarily Archlinux, otherwise Debian and OpenBSD, so these config files
will likely work on your system, possibly with a little tweaking.

## BUGS

Find a bug? Just post a new issue on [Github](https://github.com/hcartiaux/dotfiles/issues)!
