# Hyacinthe Cartiaux Dot Files

These are my configuration files for `bash`, `git`, `vim` etc. so as to set up a
system the way I like it.

In the sequel, when providing a command, `$>` denotes a prompt and is not part
of the commands.

## Pre-requisites

You should install the following elements to use the full functionality of
these config files:

* zsh
* zsh-completions
* bash
* bash-completions
* screen
* tmux
* git
* subversion
* vim
* ssh

## Installation

Run the following commands:

    $> git clone https://github.com/hcartiaux/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    $> ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

## Environment

I am running primarily on Archlinux, otherwise on Debian so these config files
will likely work on your system, eventually with a little tweaking.

## BUGS

Find a bug? Just post a new issue on [Github](https://github.com/hcartiaux/dotfiles/issues)!
